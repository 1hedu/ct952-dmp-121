### 12.68 DSP-model progress — the display state machine (0x5abb4) is only ever sent event 7; it never receives the next event

Attacking the state-7 gate (crutches VDEC_IDLE+VSYNC_KEEP, SKIP_READY OFF). Findings:

- **`0x5af60` (the DISPSTATE stepper) is INSIDE `0x5abb4`** — `0x5abb4(event)` IS the
  display state-machine handler; it records `event` into DISPSTATE `[0x40039949]` and
  toggles READYFLAG bit 0x20 transiently (guarded so `event==0xd` is special-cased, so
  "reach 0xd" was a partial misread — 0xd is a *reset/clear* arg, not a target).
- **`0x5abb4` is only ever called with event `7`** (`CT952_PCWATCH` on 0x5abb4:
  callers `0x5f070`, `0x420a8`, `0x41a90` — all `o0=7`). Events 8..? are never sent.
- **`DISPSTATE` is written `7` once (33.8M) and never changes** (new `CT952_WWATCH`
  taps on `0x40039949`/`0x4003996c`). `READYFLAG` bit 0x20 only *pulses* (set at
  33.6M/47.5M by `0x5a6c8`, cleared ~450K instr later by `0x36ff0`).

**Interpretation:** the display event sequence stalls at event 7. Event 7 correlates
with **source 7** (the recurring internal-source index; F_REQ bit0x80 == source 7,
`0x5abb4(7)`, `0xafd8(7)`). So the machine is parked in "source-7 / internal-source"
handling and never receives the follow-on event that would advance it — and
`0x5abb4(7)` (called from boot-init `0x41a90`) does not return, which is what forced
`SKIP_READY`.

**Open (next focused step):** find who *should* send the next display event after 7
(the follow-on `0x5abb4(N)` for N>7, or the internal advance inside `0x5abb4(7)`) and
what decoder/display condition gates it. That producer — a VSYNC-ISR display step or a
sibling thread — is the exact DSP/display behavior to model so `0x5abb4(7)` completes
and returns naturally. The event-7 stall + source-7 correlation strongly suggest the
missing piece is the **internal-source "ready" signal** the display sequencer waits on
before stepping past event 7. New WWATCH taps: DISPSTATE 0x40039949, READYFLAG 0x4003996c.
